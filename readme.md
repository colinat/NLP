# NLP

## Aim

   Learn/recall some of the key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP for short). I'll be using Python to demonstrate the concepts.

   You'll need to an IDE such as Spyder or Jupyter Notebook to work with your Python programs.

## Basic Foundation Needed

It is assumed you already know the basics of Python before progressing into this topic. You can check out [here](https://colintwh.github.io/python/) to pick up Python basics otherwise.


## Why Python for NLP?

Paraphrased from an article in [sunscrapers site](https://sunscrapers.com/blog/8-best-python-natural-language-processing-nlp-libraries/): 

*The simple syntax and transparent semantics of of Python make it an excellent choice Natural Language Processing tasks. Moreover, developers can enjoy excellent support for integration with other languages and tools that come in handy for techniques like machine learning. Furthermore, there is an extensive collection of Python tools and libraries that enable developers to handle a great number of NLP-related tasks such as document classification, topic modeling, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, word vectors, and sentiment analysis.*


## Topics:

The basic concepts you'll need using pandas for basic data analysis are organised in the following chapters:
